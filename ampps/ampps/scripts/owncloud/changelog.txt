Details
-------

* Bugfix - Cleaning up `autocapitalize="off"` in files: [#15399](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/15399)

   All instances of deprecated `autocapitalize="off"` HTML attributes were replaced with
   `autocapitalize="none"` in the parent <form> tag.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/15399
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37965

* Bugfix - Google Drive file modifications should not create duplicate files: [#25826](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/25826)

   Change: Allow Storage backends to explicitly opt-in/opt-out of marking file as partial while
   uploading

   Existing files in Google Drive that were modified and saved (uploaded) would result in
   duplicate files of the same name. The root cause was appending .part to filenames for upload.
   This update first allows Storage to opt-out of .part filenames during upload and second opts
   out of .part filenames for Google Storage backend specifically.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/25826
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37062

* Bugfix - Fix exit codes of security:certificates commands: [#35364](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/35364)

   If there is an error when doing occ security:certificates:import or occ
   security:certificates:remove then the command will exit with status 1. This allows the
   caller to reliably detect if there was a problem.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/35364
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37783

* Bugfix - Translate public link sharing email subject: [#37321](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37321)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37321
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37322

* Bugfix - Only allow http/https protocol on CORS: [#38101](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38101)

   Adding a white-listed domain allowed strange protocols like ftp://owncloud.com,
   restricted to http/https

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38101

* Bugfix - Fix problem with the market app installing an app using OpenIDConnect: [#37715](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37715)

   The OpenIDConnect app uses an in-memory cache to store an OpenID session in order to avoid
   hitting the OpenID provider too much. After an app was installed, the prefix used to store
   information in the cache was changing. This was causing problems because the OpenIDConnect
   app thought the OpenID session was no longer valid and, as a consequence, it was logging out the
   user. In practice, installing an new app with the market app having logged in via OpenIDConnect
   would cause the user to logout.

   Now, the cache prefix only changes after an ownCloud upgrade. Installing an app won't cause the
   cache prefix to change, so this will fix the problem. The OpenIDConnect app will still find the
   stored session information after the new apps are installed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37715

* Bugfix - Fix expiring a wrong share entry problem: [#37729](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37729)

   If multiple links exist for the same node and, non-expired share created before expired share,
   expiredSharesJob was deleting non-expired share. This problem has been resolved. Also,
   ExpireSharesJob now handles user and group shares.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37729

* Bugfix - Fix decoding of calendars uri: [#37750](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37750)

   In case an user had calendars uri containing special characters, for instance "persönlich",
   and this user was then invited to a calendar event, the event could not be created and a 404 was
   shown in the stack trace. Reason for this was the uri not being properly decoded. The behavior
   has now been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37750

* Bugfix - Add openid client secret to the sensitive values list: [#37782](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37782)

   Openid client secret was printed as is in the config report. Now it is masked.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37782

* Bugfix - Show all shares in the "shared with you" section: [#37786](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37786)

   Previously, when a user received some shares from multiple remote servers and one of them was
   removed, the "shared with you" section didn't show any share even though the user still had
   other shares that were accessible in other remote servers.

   This is now fixed by ignoring those non-accessible remote shares. The rest of the shares will be
   shown.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37786

* Bugfix - Reshares using files:transfer-ownership cannot be transferred: [#4121](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4121)

   Received shares that have been reshared further now will not be transferred using
   files:transfer-ownership. Fixes issue with mismatching ownership after executing
   transfer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4121
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37791

* Bugfix - "Passwords do not match" message was not being translated: [#37826](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37826)

   This message is now able to be translated.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37826

* Bugfix - Fix federated share accepting problem which occurs with some apps enabled: [#37719](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37719)

   Filesystem may not set already for shared user in some cases when accepting a federated share.
   This situation broke accept federated share api. This problem has been resolved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37719
   https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/778
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37834

* Bugfix - Allow federated share name up to 255 character: [#36730](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36730)

   Receiving a federated share of a file with name greater than 63 characters was not possible.
   This problem has been resolved by extending related column length of database to 255.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36730
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37835

* Bugfix - Fix application id used for sharing settings translation: [#37846](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37846)

   "Owner language" and permission titles "Create", "Change", "Delete", "Share" were not being
   translated. Now it is translated.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37846

* Bugfix - Add metrics shared secret to the sensitive values list: [#37848](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37848)

   The metrics api shared secret was printed as is in the config report. Now it is masked.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37848

* Bugfix - Fix list of apps returned by OCS Provisioning API apps endpoint: [#37884](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37884)

   Requests to ocs/v1.php/cloud/apps without any filter now return all apps, including the
   always-enabled apps.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37884
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37901

* Bugfix - Add very minimal empty ODF files: [#37896](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37896)

   These files contain no data at all. This guarantees that when the user opens a new document in the
   richdocuments app, the language of paragraph, page size, cell date format, currency, etc.
   will be according to the current locale.

   Previous files were in German. E.g. document language (spellcheck language) was set to
   German, spreadsheet tab name was "Tabelle", etc. It was incorrect for non-German users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37896

* Bugfix - Checksums will be kept when a file is uploaded or a version is created: [#37934](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37934)

   Previously, reuploading the same file caused the checksum of the file to be reset. In addition,
   the checksum weren't being carried away when a new version of the file was created. This means
   that the versions didn't have a checksum.

   Both problems are now solved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37934

* Bugfix - Fix invisible notification container blocking mouse events: [#37941](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37941)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37941

* Bugfix - Fix display of public link shares in case avatars are disabled: [#37945](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37945)

   In case avatars were disabled through config.php and a public link was created for some file, a
   "sharing is not allowed" message was displayed when leaving the sharing panel and trying to
   access it again for that specific file. The behavior has now been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37945

* Bugfix - Clean the user's preferences only if they exist during user sync: [#37947](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37947)

   Previously, the user's preferences were cleaned during the user:sync command. This was done
   regardless of the preferences existance, which was causing the
   "userpreference.afterDeleteValue" event to be triggered always, and then, as consequence,
   the admin_audit app was logging those events. Basically, this bug was causing a log flood by the
   admin_audit app even if those preferences weren't there in the first place.

   Now we check first if those preferences exist before attempting to delete them. If they exist,
   the admin_audit app will still log that deletion, but if not nothing happens because the
   deletion won't be attempted.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37947

* Bugfix - OCS and Public WebDAV Apis should handle LoginException: [#112](https://github.com/owncloud/brute_force_protection/issues/112)

   OCS api and new public webdav api was not handle LoginException. This situation was causing
   HTTP 500 error in response. This bug has been resolved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/brute_force_protection/issues/112
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37948

* Bugfix - Properly exit and log during error in user sync command: [#37951](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37951)

   If there is an error when doing occ user:sync then the command will exit with return 1 and
   properly log the error.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4218
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37951

* Bugfix - Add a configurable number of retries on unsuccessful mountpoint move: [#37956](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37956)

   Handling of conflicting mountpoints across different share backends was improved by adding a
   configurable number of the mountpoint rename attempts. Now when the mountpoint rename has
   been failed on the user filesystem initialization due to internal backend-specific reasons
   the used mountpoint name is considered to be taken, a new name is generated and the rename
   operation could be repeated several times until it either succeeds or rename attempts limit is
   reached.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37956

* Bugfix - Fix icon alignment when avatars are disabled: [#37964](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37964)

   Action icons for the sharee list view, when you want to know who are you sharing to, where being
   pushed to the left when the avatars were disabled, breaking part of the layout.

   Those icons are now aligned.

* Bugfix - Fix file target in the accept share API call: [#37973](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37973)

   If you had a custom share_folder set in the config.php file and the auto-accept feature for the
   internal user sharing was disabled, when a user accepted the user share, the file target in the
   API response contained the share_folder duplicated. This was limited to the API response.

   Now the API responds correctly, and the file target doesn't have the share_folder duplicated

* Bugfix - Fix for Google Docs not syncing with error "server reported no size": [#37997](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37997)

   Users with Google Drive connected external storage were previously subjected to a "server
   reported no size" error in desktop sync client for every Google Doc that attempted to sync.
   Additionally, the Google Doc would not be downloaded.

* Bugfix - Do not emit "share.failedpasswordcheck" events for authenticated links: [#138](https://github.com/owncloud/brute_force_protection/issues/138)

   ShareManager was checking password of already authenticated public links. This situation
   led to wrong "share.failedpasswordcheck" events emitting in already authenticated links.
   This problem has been resolved by first checking link already authenticated.

   Since the OCS_APIREQUEST header was removed we needed to either implement the header again or
   implement another way to properly check cookie authenticated ocs requests.

* Bugfix - Fix logging when loading an apps fails: [#38037](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38037)

   Some apps use the variable $app in app.php - this overwrites the variable in requireAppFile and
   causes the error

* Bugfix - Properly handle StorageNotAvailableException in share external: [#38042](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38042)

   Users with Federated Shares of which storage was unavailable, were encountering issues when
   working with the shares (e.g. unsharing or listing). It was caused by unhandled exception.

* Bugfix - Avoid retrieving user root iteratively in share controller: [#4107](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4107)

   There was a performance problem that with many shares, the "share tab" was slow to display
   entries. Now the performance of displaying that tab should be better as we avoid retrieving the
   same information for all the shares

* Bugfix - Pick the translations from templates included from other apps: [#38072](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38072)

   Some apps can include template parts from a different app, normally from core. From example,
   the activity app can include content from the core templates to be used in the activity email.

   The translated strings were picked from the original app even though the template was within
   core space. As a result, some string weren't translated because of the missing translation for
   those strings in the original app. Note that core had the strings correctly translated.

   Now the translations are picked from the requested app template as intended, instead of
   looking for them in the original app.

* Bugfix - Override browser Accept-Language header in ajax requests: [#38073](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38073)

   wrong language sometimes. Now this header is set globally to match the current user language.

* Bugfix - SSL check when adding a public link to your ownCloud: [#4241](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4241)

   Prior to this fix, a SSL certificate check was performed when adding a public link to your
   ownCloud. As this check was done on the base URL of the server, it could cause some issues, for
   example endless redirect loops. This fix gets rid of the SSL check because the storage-check
   afterwards also checks the validity of the server's SSL certificate. This check is being made
   on /status.php, thus it likely wont end up in a redirect loop.

* Enhancement - Add support for date expiration on remote shares: [#37548](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37548)

   An expiration date can be set now for shares originating in your server. This feature behaves
   the same as the expiration for user, group and link shares.

   The expiration is controlled in the source server (server A). The target server (server B)
   won't know about the expiration. Once the share expires, the target server (server B) won't be
   able to access to those shares and it will remove them automatically

   This feature won't work for shares that are grabbed from a public link: if source server (server
   A) shares a file / folder via link, and an user from the target server (server B) adds that link to
   his ownCloud; in this case, this "remote share expiration" won't apply.

   In addition, the same as happens with user, group and link shares, the share recipient won't
   have control over the expiration date.

* Enhancement - Support pre-signed urls: [#37634](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37634)

   Ocis-web (Phoenix) doesn't use cookies for authentication but the "Bearer" header.

   This means that we can only fetch data using XHR or the fetch API but cannot use URLs directly in
   image tags, also cannot download files directly.

   To solve this, we now support pre-signed URLs. This means that before creating an image tag or
   starting a download, we send an authenticated request to the server (OC 10 or OCIS) to ask for a
   pre-signed URL pointing at a specific resource. Then said URL can be forwarded either to an
   image tag (for thumbnails) or to another browser window to trigger a download.

   supported: .sgi, .rgb, .rgba, .bw, .int, .inta. These files will be associated with the
   mimetype image/sgi. This mimetype is not officially registered. This needs the imagick php
   extension to be installed.

* Enhancement - Allow getting the share list filtered by share type via API: [#38000](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38000)

   Previously, the share API returned all the shares. There were some filters, but you weren't
   able to filter by share type. You couldn't get only your link shares.

   Now the API allows filtering by share type, along with the filters previously available. The
   web UI is using this filtering now.

* Enhancement - GetShare API request's "subfiles" parameter allows new interactions: [#38053](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38053)

   Previously, the "subfiles" parameter required only the "path" parameter, and the rest of the
   parameters were ignored.

   Now, the "subfiles" parameter still requires the "path" parameter, but it also interacts with
   the "reshares" parameter as well as the "share_types" parameter to provide additional
   filtering capabilities

* Enhancement - Add new method in the PHP API interface: [#38054](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38054)

   The share manager interface in the PHP API has a new "getSharesByPath" method available
